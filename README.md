1) Mathematical demonstration of Goldbach's conjecture + From a series of timely tide levels in the city of Mar del Plata
for an entire year (a table of values indicating the height in meters of the tide to
each of the 8,760 hours in the year) seeks to find a relationship between
these values and the occurrence of underdogs that negatively impact a variety of
coastal activities.


2) The following report seeks to obtain information on water infiltration and the temporary rate of water into the soil after precipitation by using the Green-Ampt model. This methodology provides an analytical solution that allows to obtain an approximation of these values. To find such solutions, mathematical methods such as Newton-Raphson's or Bisection's are used.
